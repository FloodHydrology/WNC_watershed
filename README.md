# WNC_watershed
This repository contains scripts that (1) delineate an experimental watershed in western North Carolina and (2) conduct subsequent topographic analyses. Importantly, the associated scripts use R to initiate [WhiteBox tools](http://www.uoguelph.ca/~hydrogeo/WhiteboxTools/index.html).
